# VGGVox-Keras
This is a line-by-line transliteration of the MatLab MatConvNet implementation of the model to Python's Keras. The demo is 100% working and yields the same results as the MatConvNet based demo.

I did not create the architecture of the VGGVox model. The model and corresponding demo were developed by Arsha Nagrani and her colleagues, and are available at: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/

I am releasing this VGGVox Keras implementation under an MIT license so feel free to use it for your own research purposes. If you do, make sure to cite the following paper for which this implementation was made:
